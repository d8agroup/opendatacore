ODC
===


Introduction
------------

ODC is a powerful open source data processing engine designed to enable data collection, augmentation, search,
filtering and analytics.


Project History
---------------
At MetaLayer we have been developing ODC as a core component of our enterprise data processing and visualization
solutions. We have decided to share this work with the world and to continue the development and support of ODC as a
FOSS solution.


Project Goals
-------------
ODC is designed to be a content agnostic platform for collecting, augmenting, indexing, searching, filtering and
performing analytics against Big Data sets.


Version History
---------------
As this project has been migrated from a close source solution it has been necessary to remove all previous version
history from the repo. This is a shame but it unavoidable given the client specific nature of out enterprise deployments
over the years. We are kicking the version numbering off at V0.0.1 (Early Alpha) because we have big plans for ODC as a
FOSS solution and intend to rework - with your help ;) - many of the aspect of the codebase over the coming months.


Developing On ODC
-----------------
You are most welcome to download and build data focused application on top of ODC from the very beginning (we have three
enterprise systems that are currently powered by this codebase) but for the time being the documentation is light and
the dependencies are many. If you would like any help and support configuring ODC please reach out to mg [at] metalayer
